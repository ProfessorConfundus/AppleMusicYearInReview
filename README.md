## About Core
Core, otherwise known as Apple Music Year in Review, aims to be the Spotify Wrapped of Apple Music, providing stats like total time listening to music, top artists, top genres, most skipped songs, and more.
## How Core works
Thanks to Article 15 of the EU's GDPR, individuals can request a copy of their data from data controllers, which, in Core's case, is Apple. Because of this, we can access a copy of all statistics that Apple gather about your usage of Apple Music.
## Core vs Apple Music Replay

- Top 10 Songs (in plays)
